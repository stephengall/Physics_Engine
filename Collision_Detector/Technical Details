---Collision detection and resolution---
  - Collision detection between rotated rectangles is achieved using SAT (Seperating axis theorem).
  - Once collision between two rectangles is detected, a vector along the minimum depth of the collision
    is found.
  - Each rectangle is moved along this vector at half the depth of the collision, in opposite directions.
